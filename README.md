# Introduction to Autoregressive (AR) Models in Time Series Analysis

---

## What is a Time Series?

A **time series** is a sequence of data points collected or recorded at regular time intervals. Examples:

* Daily temperature
* Stock prices every minute
* Monthly sales of a product

Analyzing time series helps us understand patterns and make predictions.

## What are Autoregressive (AR) Models?

Autoregressive models are a way to **model and predict time series data** by assuming that the current value depends on its own past values.

Think of it like this:

> Today’s value depends on what happened yesterday, the day before yesterday, and so on.

---

## Why Use AR Models?

* Many natural and economic processes have **memory** — the past influences the present.
* AR models capture this **dependency** with simple formulas.
* They are foundational building blocks in forecasting.

## The General Idea of AR Models

An AR model of order **p**, written AR(p), uses the last *p* observations to predict the current value.

Mathematically:

$$
X_t = c + \phi_1 X_{t-1} + \phi_2 X_{t-2} + \dots + \phi_p X_{t-p} + \epsilon_t
$$

Where:

* $X_t$ = value at time $t$
* $c$ = constant (like a baseline)
* $\phi_1, \phi_2, \dots, \phi_p$ = parameters that measure how much past values affect the current value
* $\epsilon_t$ = random noise (unpredictable fluctuations)

---

## Breaking It Down With an Example: AR(1)

The simplest AR model is AR(1):

$$
X_t = c + \phi_1 X_{t-1} + \epsilon_t
$$

* Today’s value depends **only on yesterday’s value** and some noise.
* If $\phi_1$ is close to 1, yesterday’s value strongly influences today.
* If $\phi_1$ is close to 0, today’s value is almost independent of yesterday.

---

## Higher-Order AR Models (AR(2), AR(3), ...)

Sometimes, the process depends on more than just one past value:

* AR(2) uses the last 2 values: $X_{t-1}$ and $X_{t-2}$
* AR(3) uses the last 3 values
* And so on...

Each added term lets the model capture more complex patterns like cycles or trends.

---

## Intuition: Why Does This Work?

Imagine measuring daily temperatures:

* Today’s temperature is influenced by yesterday’s weather.
* But maybe also by the day before yesterday (because heat lingers).
* An AR model captures this “memory” mathematically.

---

## What About the Noise $\epsilon_t$?

* It accounts for randomness or influences we can’t explain.
* We assume noise is random and has no pattern (white noise).
* It’s what makes predictions uncertain.

---

## How to Choose the Order $p$?

* Use tools like **AIC** or **BIC** criteria (statistical scores).
* Look at plots of autocorrelation to see how many past values influence the current one.
* Try simple models first (like AR(1)) and increase complexity only if needed.

## Summary Table

| Model | Depends on...     | Simple explanation               |
| ----- | ----------------- | -------------------------------- |
| AR(1) | 1 previous value  | Today depends on yesterday only  |
| AR(2) | 2 previous values | Today depends on last two days   |
| AR(3) | 3 previous values | Today depends on last three days |
| ...   | ...               | ...                              |

## Real-World Use Cases

* Forecasting stock prices
* Predicting weather patterns
* Modeling economic indicators
* Any data that evolves over time with some memory
